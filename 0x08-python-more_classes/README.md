Class: The class is a user-defined data structure that binds the data members and methods into a single unit. Class is a blueprint or code template for object creation. Using a class, you can create as many objects as you want.
Object: An object is an instance of a class. It is a collection of attributes (variables) and methods. We use the object of a class to perform actions.
Objects have two characteristics: They have states and behaviors (object has attributes and methods attached to it) Attributes represent its state, and methods represent its behavior. Using its methods, we can modify its state.
