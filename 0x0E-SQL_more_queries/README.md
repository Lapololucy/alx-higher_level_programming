MySQL is an open-source relational database management system. It is commonly deployed as part of the LAMP stack (which stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP) and, as of this writing, is the most popular open-source database in the world.

This guide outlines how to create a new MySQL user and grant them the permissions needed to perform a variety of actions.
In order to follow along with this guide, you’ll need access to a MySQL database. This guide assumes that this database is installed on a virtual private server running Ubuntu 20.04, though the principles it outlines should be applicable regardless of how you access your database.

If you don’t have access to a MySQL database and would like to set one up yourself, you can follow one of our guides on How To Install MySQL. Again, regardless of your server’s underlying operating system, the methods for creating a new MySQL user and granting them permissions will generally be the same.
