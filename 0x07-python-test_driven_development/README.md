General Requirements
Python Script:

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5)
All files ends with a new line
Python Scripts: The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
There is a README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project
All files are executable
All coded used the pycodestyle (version 2.8.)

Python Test Cases:

Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All files ends with a new line
All test files are inside a folder tests
All test files are text files with extension: .txt)
All tests are executed using the command: python3 -m doctest ./tests/*
All the modules have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)')
All functions have a documentation (python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)') Note: A documentation is not a simple word, it’s a real sentence explaining what’s the purpose of the module, class or method (the length of it will be verified) We strongly encourage you to work together on test cases, so that you don’t miss any edge case – The Checker is checking for tests!
